# PDF_Scraper

I developed a tool that can scan a PDF document and locate a specified keyword. The tool can extract the 30 words preceding and following the keyword to create sentences that provide contextual information related to the keyword. Essentially, the tool is a PDF keyword scraper that generates meaningful sentences surrounding the specified keyword.

The current keyword being analyzed is "provide $". This keyword has been tested on the PDF version of Canada's Federal Budget 2023, and the tool is able to extract a concise list of areas where the Canadian Government is allocating additional funding.
